# Chapter 6 (Exercises)

1. Implement a program which reads and displays a series of temperature readings for a given week. Additionally, create a method that tells if a day was hot or not.
    - Create a method called `enterTemps` that fills the temperature readings for a given week.
    - Create a method called `displayTems` that displays all of the temperature readings.
    - Create a method called `wasHot` that displays all of the temperatures greater than 18Â°.

2. Implement some basic array operations in methods that return:
    - The sum of all the elements in an array.
    - The maximum item in an array.
    - A boolean that tells if an array contains certain value.
    - The index position of a desired number.
    - The average of all the elements in an array.
    - All of the elements that are greater than the average.
    - All of the items in the array.
